## Designing a Battle Map Class: Properties and Considerations

**Understanding the Battle Map**

A battle map is essentially a 2D grid of tiles, each representing a specific area or terrain type within the game world. To accommodate different elevations or levels, we'll introduce a `y`-axis position for each tile.

**Proposed Properties for the Battle Map Class**

1. **Grid Dimensions:**
* `width`: The number of tiles horizontally.
* `height`: The number of tiles vertically.

2. **Tile Properties:**
* `tileWidth`: The width of each tile in pixels.
* `tileHeight`: The height of each tile in pixels.
* `tileYOffset`: The vertical offset between tiles at different levels.

3. **Tile Data Structure:**
* A 2D array or matrix to store tile information. Each element in the array would represent a tile and could contain properties like:
    * `terrainType`: The type of terrain (e.g., grass, forest, water).
* `elevation`: The elevation level of the tile.
* `isPassable`: Whether units can move over the tile.
* `occupant`: The unit currently occupying the tile (if any).

4. **Level Information:**
* A list or array to store information about each level or elevation in the map. Each element in this list could contain:
    * `levelIndex`: A unique identifier for the level.
* `yPosition`: The y-coordinate of the level.
* `tiles`: A reference to the tiles that belong to this level.

**Example Implementation (Python):**

```python
class BattleMap:
    def __init__(self, width, height, tile_width, tile_height, tile_y_offset):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.tile_width = tile_width
        self.tile_height = tile_height
        self.tile_y_offset = tile_y_offset

        self.tiles = [[None for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
        self.levels = []

    def add_level(self, level_index, y_position):
        self.levels.append({"level_index": level_index, "y_position": y_position, "tiles": []})

    # ... other methods for manipulating tiles, levels, and units
```

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Pathfinding:** Implement a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*) that takes into account tile elevations and passability.
* **Unit Movement:** Ensure that unit movement respects tile elevations and terrain types.
* **Rendering:** Consider using a tile-based rendering system to efficiently draw the map and its contents.
* **Level Transitions:** If your game involves transitioning between levels, implement a mechanism to handle this smoothly.

    By carefully designing your battle map class and considering these factors, you'll create a robust and flexible foundation for your game's battle mechanics.
